Question: What is the difference between Implicit Wait, Explicit Wait, and Fluent Wait in Selenium WebDriver?
Answer:

Implicit Wait: The WebDriver waits for a specified amount of time when trying to locate an element
if it is not immediately present. This is applied automatically to all findElement and findElements calls.

Explicit Wait: Here, the WebDriver waits for a specific condition to be met before proceeding with the execution of code.
This allows waiting for specific events, such as the appearance of an element or the fulfillment of a custom condition.

Fluent Wait: This is a flexible waiting option that waits for specific conditions but also considers a polling interval
and exceptions. It provides more control over the waiting conditions.
